SAS/GRAPH® and SAS Viya® 4 Mapping Examples

Overview
This file contains SAS code samples that enable you to create maps as seen in SAS/GRAPH and Base SAS: Mapping Reference for SAS Viya 4. The sample programs are valid for SAS Viya 2021.1.5 and later releases. Unless otherwise noted in the sample file header, the programs will run in earlier versions of SAS Viya. The programs are written to run in SAS Studio. The examples are arranged by procedure. Each procedure folder contains sample programs for that procedure that use mapping data from the MAPSGFK library. Subfolder Traditional_Data, when available, contains sample programs that use mapping data from the traditional MAPSSAS or MAPS library. The MAPSSAS and MAPS librefs point to the same traditional map data sets.
